## User Experience (UX)

* ### User Stories
  - #### First Time Visitor Goals
  
  - #### Returning Visitor Goals
    
  - #### Frequent User Goals

    
* Design Considerations
  - Colour Scheme
  
  The colour scheme is the standard bootstrap colour scheme using white background, black text and black or white buttons.

  Messages will displayed using bootstrap toasts in a simple pop up

  There will be a colour coded bar above the toasts to signify their type using standard bootstrap colour coding.
  error - #dc3545 Red
  warning - #ffc107 Orange
  success - #28a745 Green
  information - #17a2b8 Cyan
  
  - Typography
    
    For simplicity, only one font style will be used. The Lato font is a clear sans-serif font which works well for all elements of the site. The fallback sans-serif is specified in case the Poppins font fails to load.

## Design Strategy

### The strategy plane:
**What are you aiming to achieve in the first place and for whom?**

*** Users
The site is designed to allow visitors to the site to register and ask questions of the site owner.

Users should be able to use the site without needing additional instruction.

The interface should be simple and work on a variety of devices.

Submitted questions should be visible to users with a default answer ("Awaiting answer") until they are answered by the admin.

***Admin
Once answered, questions should be assigned to an appropriate category to help other users to find the answer to their question.

The admin should be able to create and edit categories.

The admin should be able to assign questions to categories.

Each question should be able to belong to only one category.

### The scope plane:
**Which features, based on information from the strategy plane, do you want to include in your design?**

**Must Have**

Users must be able to submit questions.

Questions and answers must be displayed on the page.

There must be a contact form

Admins must be able to answer a question and assign it to one of the categories.

Admins must be able to add and edit categories.

**Could Have**

When a new question is submitted, it could automatically be assigned to a "Pending" category


**Future plans**

A future version could allow users to upvote answers to affect their position in the list

A furture version could include a password recovery option using the user's email address.

When a new question is submitted, it could send an email notification to an admin

**Usability**
Users are assumed to be accessing the site on a mobile device so the site should adopt a mobile first design.

Users should be able to navigate the site without instructions, so navigation should be intuitive.

For the initial build, this site will incorporate:
* The basic pages.
* Registration and login pages
* A form to submit a new question.
* A contact form
* An Accordion section will contain the category headings allowing quick access to each category's answers.
* An Admin area to answer questions
* An admin area to add and edit categories.

**Future Development:**
* An voting system to allow users to upvote answers.
* Password recovery option
* email notifications of new questions and answers

### The structure plane:
**How is the information structured and how is it logically grouped?**

The information should be grouped by;

* The landing page will show the basic company information.
* This is a small website for the company and the FAQ is just one section of the site.
* The main FAQ page will contain the Accordion section with answer categories. 
* A page will contain the Ask Question form.
* A page will handle the user registration.
* A page will handle the user profile including account deletion
* Terms and conditions for registration should be on a modal.

* Admin functions will only be visible to the admin user. 


### The skeleton plane:
**How will our information be represented, and how will the user navigate to the information and the features?**

The main user page will contain a menu which allows users and the admin to login and access further pages

Messages will be displayed to tell the user their question has been submitted and to confirm actions.

### The surface plane:
**What will the finished product look like? What colors, typography, and design elements will we use?**

Wireframes for the site are below:

## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

* ### User Stories
  - #### First Time Visitor Goals
  
    a. As a first time visitor, I would like to be able to register to ask questions.

    There is a registration page to allow users to create an account which will allow them to ask a question
  
    b. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to ask a question without needing further instructions.

    On clicking the 'Ask Quesion" button, if the user is not logged in, a modal will prompt the user to log in or register a new account.

  ![User not logged in modal](/faq/static/images/modal1.JPG "User not logged in modal")

    c. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to see if my question has already been answered.

    All visitors can access the questions and answers without having to create an account
    
  - #### Returning Visitor Goals
  
    a. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to see if the question I asked, has been answered.

    A logged in user can see their questions and answers when logged into their profile page

    b. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to delete a question I asked

    The questions on the user's profile page each have a delete button to give the option to delete

    c. As a returning visitor, I would like to contact the site owner

    There is a contact form 
    
  - #### Frequent User Goals
  
    a. As a frequent user, I want to be able to browse the questions asked by others.

    All users can see the questions and answers on the faq page

    b. As a frequent user, I want to be able to delete my account and all questions I asked

    The user profile page has an option to delete the user account. This will also automatically delete all that users questions
    
### Further Testing

#### Testing the register function for valid entries
While building the register function, I used conditional print statements to check that the inputs were valid before coding the functionality. eg

      `if terms != 'on':
        print ("Terms not accepted")`

      `if password1 != password2:
        print("Passwords don't match")`

      `if terms and (password1 == password2):
        print("Everything OK")`

#### Testing the user and admin options.

All of the nav links were tested from each page for functionality before the conditionals were added to restrict access to users or admins as apppropriate.
These links were then tested again from each page with logged in user and admin omly options to confirm that they funtion correctly.

The functionality of the user asking questions has been checked to ensure that the user can only post when logged in and that the question can only be deleted by the user.

The answer question function has been tested to ensure that only the admin can answer questions and assign a category to the question.

Only the admin is able to create, edit and delete categories. This has been checked to ensure the non-admin users do not have this ability.

Test questions and answers have been submitted, assigned to categories and then the category deleted to ensure that the cascade workes to delete the appropriate questions.

Test questions and answers have been submitted, assigned to categories and then the user deleted to ensure that the cascade workes to delete the appropriate questions.


#### Layout tests

The Website was tested on Google Chrome on both a laptop, tablet and mobile phone for functionality and responsiveness

The responsivity of the website was checked on a variety of devices using [Responsive Design Checkers](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/checker.php?url=app-faq.herokuapp.com&width=1500&height=1200) and [AmIResponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://app-faq.herokuapp.com)

Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Solved Bugs

Bug: Form data not being passed to the @app.route

Cause: The form was built with `id` attributes but not `name` attributes

Solution: Added `name` attributes to the form elements

------------------------------------------------------------

Bug: The 'Ask Question button on the faq page allowed anyone to ask a question without logging in

Cause: All users need to be able to view the faq whether logged in or not.

Solution: Add a pop up modal if the usert is not logged in, to offer a redirect to register page

------------------------------------------------------------

Bug: userid session not set on registration enabling the user to ask a question without an id which throws an error

Cause: userid session set on login only

Solution: added userid session declaration into register route

------------------------------------------------------------

Bug: User 'logged out' message not showing on logout

Cause: Flashed messages are session variables and are cleared when the session is cleared.

Solution: Call session.clear() before setting the flashed message

------------------------------------------------------------

Bug: Unable to add questions on initial deployment.

Cause: New questions assigned to category-name 'Unanswered' with category.id '0'. Category doesn't exist on creation

Solution: Add conditional in categories route to check category.id[0] exists and add if not create it

------------------------------------------------------------

Bug: No way to create first user as admin.

Cause: All users are created as non-admin by default

Solution: Check if admin exists and if not, add first user as admin on registration
